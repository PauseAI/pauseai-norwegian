	p(doom) is the probability of very bad outcomes (e.g. human extinction) as a result of AI. This
	most often refers to the likelihood of <a href="https://pauseai.info/ai-takeover">AI taking over</a> from humanity,
	but different scenarios can also constitute "doom". For example, a large portion of the population
	dying due to a novel biological weapon created by AI, social collapse due to a
	<a href="https://pauseai.info/cybersecurity-risks">large-scale cyber attack</a>, or AI causing a nuclear war. Note that
	not everyone is using the same definition when talking about their p(doom) values. Most notably
	the time horizon is often not specified, which makes comparing a bit difficult.

	However high your p(doom) is, you probably agree that we should not allow AI companies to gamble
	with our future.
